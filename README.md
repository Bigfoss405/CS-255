Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project was created for a company that was striving to create an easily accessible way to prepare for your driving test.

What did you do particularly well?
I feel as if my diagrams for project two were done with great care and attention to detail.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the detailing in project two and go further in depth about the system at hand.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I looked at the general needs of the Client and turned it into a system that suits their needs and requires minimal effort from the client to access. The User is the one that will be effected most by what you create, therefore it is imperative to put their view at the top of your list when creating an app.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
Designing software starts with understanding requirements, planning the system structure, and choosing the right tools.
